      <h3> What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
      <p id="bullets">
        <ul>
          <li> I learned that I need to do even more work than I imagined to reduce my negative self-talk and the voice of my ego, especially when dealing with stressful situations.</li>
          <li>  I learned that my ego is very good at playing tricks one me, like convincing me that default way of communicating with others is better than what it is, when it can in reality improve greatly from using the reflective listening technique as I have tendency to, when hearing a person speak about a problem, neglect and overlook the benefits to be had for that person by helping them to feel heard.</li>
          <li>I learned that, while difficult and challenging, I enjoy writing and reflecting on my thoughts and that this activity has an overall positive effect on my frame of mind. </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
      <p>Programming is inherently about problem-solving, and in situations where you encounter a problem that you haven't faced before, you need to <em>learn</em> how to find a solution. The two concepts are therefore strongly interrelated and we, as a society or collective of individuals, have learned and continue to learn from our collective experiences that some ways of learning are more productive, efficient, and sustainable than others. Over the past 200 years, our understanding of how we think and how our brains work through the development of experimental psychology and this science has led us to where we are today where we have a greater appreciation for how we are influenced by our emotions, often choosing to act in ways that we know to not be objectively reasonable. When we deal with problems, we are dealing with both our emotions and our reason, to neglect one has the potential to significantly affect the other. For these reasons, the role of values, empathy and self-awareness is to promote and advocate for the importance of our emotional intelligence and the responsibility that we have for ourselves and for others that we interact with when faced with a choice as to how we deal with a situation.</p>

      <div class= "Content-section EQ">
      <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
      <p>While I feel that it shouldn't, it never fails to surprise me how vast the difference can be between theory and practice, between the idea of/talking about doing something and then actually doing it. </p>
     </div>
      
      <div class= "Content-section EQ">
      <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
      <p>The entire process of reflecting on oneself, putting words to paper/into a text file, and then publishing that is a commitment that I found to be both emotionally and intellectually challenging. I tend to keep my thoughts to myself or to an intimate group of friends/family that I have known for a long time, so the idea of communicating openly about personal thoughts and information with people that I hardly know is something that I find/found rather difficult.  </p>
      </div>

      <div class= "Content-section EQ">
      <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
      <p>If we consider progamming to be about problem-solving and coding to be about learning the language that you use to interface with the computer then both by their very nature involve dealing with problems and communication, not only with a computer but also with people. </p>
      </div>

      <div class= "Content-section EQ">
      <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? </h3>
      <p>Not at all! As discussed above, programming is about problem-solving and the better emotionally equipped we are to deal with challenges and frustrations, the better able we will be to learn and to work with and collaborate with others, and the better able we will be to feel better about ourselves which in turn, at least theoretically, can maximise our longevity.</p>
