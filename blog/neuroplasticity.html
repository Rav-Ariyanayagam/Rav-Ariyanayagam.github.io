        <h3>What is neuroplasticity?</h3>

        <P>The term <em>neuroplasticity</em> refers to our brain's ability to restructure or rewire itself when it recognises the need for adaption.  As previously touched on in my post on  <a href="emotional-intelligence.html" target="_self">emotional intelligence</a>, our conception of how the brain works and what it is capable of, notably beyond infancy and after the age of 25, has changed significantly in recent decades. </p>
      
        <p>We now understand that our brain can continue developing and changing throughout the entirety of our lives, and that our thoughts, physical activity, emotions, nutrition, sleep habits and other lifestyle choices are all capable of having an effect on our physical brains.</p>

        <p>This new information proves that how we choose to respond in a situation is an action with the potential to literally change our brains, both for the better or for the worse, and gives us another area of health, our minds and brains, for which we should all take responsiblity, however challenging that might be for us.</p>

        <p>Some activities that have been scientifically proven to improve the brain's adaptability include:</p>
        <ul></p>
          <li>Learning a new language</li>
          <li>Playing video games</li>
          <li>Making music</li>
          <li>Exercising</li>
          <li>Making art</li>
          <li>Meditating</li>
        </ul>
        </p>


        <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>

        <p>Leaning heavily on our current understanding of neuroplasticity, the concept of the <em>growth mindset</em>, as described by American psychologist Carol Dweck, advocates for an approach of ongoing learning and development, and the benefits of making an effort for our physical, mental, and emotional health. It argues that how we respond to and conceptualise situations, even how we talk to ourselves, can be relevant and significant factors in determining the outcome of our efforts, and that succes . This view,  places itself in direct opposition to the idea of a "fixed mindset", an essentially deterministic view of the world in which intelligence is considered to be static</p>
