        <h3>JavaScript - understanding its relationship with CSS and HTML</h3>

        <p>If you were to draw a comparison between how a website is built with how a physical house is built, then: </p>

        <p></p>
          
        <p><b>HTML</b> would represent the fundamental structural design of the house that determines the layout of that house - this includes the number of rooms, the different types of rooms (such as the entrance, kitchen, lounge, bathroom, etc.) and the content of those rooms.</p>

        <p></p>
          <p><b>CSS</b> is concerned with aesthetic of the building and its visual appearance of , this could be the paint, wallpaper or lighting.</p>

          <p></p>
          <P><b>JavaScript</b> is what makes a website dynamic and, for the purpose of this analogy, a house genuinely liveable - it's the plumbing required for the water, it's the wiring that's required for electricity, and the switches that allow you turn that electricity on and off.</p>
      
        <p></p>

        <h3>Control flow and loops, arrays, and objects</h3>

        <p><em>Control flow</em> refers to the sequence in which a computer will execute the code in a JavaScript file. By default, the computer will begin at the top and works its way down to the last line at the end. JavaScript files can have loops or conditional statements that can affect the control flow. </p>

        <p></p>

        <p><em>Loops</em> are a syntactical option in JavaScript that offer an efficient way of writing out tasks that need to be executed a number of times. The logic of the code requires that an action be undertaken either for a certain specified number of times or until a condition is met. When a computer encounters the loop code in a JavaScript file, this alters the control flow by causing the computer to 'loop through' that code until the specified conditions have been met. </p> 

        <p></p>
        <p><em>Arrays</em> in JavaScript is a type of object that can store multiple items under a single variable name. These are particularly useful to write code that is concise and facilitate computational logic.  </p>
        <p></p>
        <p><em>Objects</em> are the fundamental building block of JavaScript and are containers for named values that are referred to as "properties" That is to a A set of values is effective </p>

        <h3>The Document Object Model (DOM)</h3>

        <h5><b>Diagram: How the DOM sees an HTML document as an object</b></h5>
  

        <p>The Document Object Model (DOM), as the name suggests, is a method for representing the data in a document as an object, effectively enabling it to be manipulated by a programming interface. In the example of a basic website, the static data that is contained in both the HTML and/or CSS files can be interpreted as an object by a language (such as JavaScript) that can then manipulate that object to make changes to the original, static data, effectively rendering it (the website/data) dynamic.</p>

        <h3>Functions</h3>

        <div class="image"> <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*jWEwtWpDroJL-tVIOeXWgg.png"></div>

        <p>Functions in JavaScript are blocks of code that take an input value and, once the function has been 'called',  will execute the task and return/calculate the output. Function are effectively a set of instructions that serve to execute a particular task or to calculate a value and have been referred to as a "subprogram". The output of a function can be a string, an array, a value, an object, even a function.
