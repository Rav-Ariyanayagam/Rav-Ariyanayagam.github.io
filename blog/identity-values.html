          <h3>Identity, Values, and Strengths</h3>
          
          <p>My name's Rav (he/him) and I'm based in Auckland, New Zealand. Born in France, I moved to New Zealand while still in primary school and grew up here. I've worked as an analyst in both the private and public sectors, here in New Zealand but also in France, India, and Romania.</p>
          
          
          <p>My roots are Sri Lankan on my father’s side and Samoan-Swedish-German on my mother’s and this has fostered an appreciation for diversity from a young age. Family, community, honesty, dialogue, empathy, and integrity are all very important to me, but so are humility and the ability to compromise.</p>

        <p>Curious by nature, I'm a tenacious learner with a critical mind. That place where culture, media, music, and technology combine - the Internet - and its impact on how we live fascinates me and I want to be able to develop my professional and technical skills to actively contribute to that, hopefully to something that can have a positive social impact, and that's why I'm here at Dev Academy.</p>
