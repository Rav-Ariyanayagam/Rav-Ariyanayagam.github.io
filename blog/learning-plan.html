<h3>2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
<h3><em>Strengths</em></h3>
<p>I am a motivated learner who takes responsibility for my personal and professional education and development. My critical thinking skills are well developed and I am unafraid to ask questions. In the face of difficulties and challenges, I am resilient and driven to make the efforts required in order to achieve my goals.</p>
<h3><em>limitations</em></h3>
<p>In attempting to take individual responsibility for my learning, I sometimes take too long to seek assistance when it is required. This can lead to placing avoidable pressure on myself and making my work more difficult than it could be and/or taking longer than it could have to complete. The cumulative effect of all of this is find myself in an unsustainable pattern where I endure avoidable stress that is both emotionally and physically tiring, ultimately taking a toll on my general health. </p>

<div class=" Content-section Actions">
<h3>3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Healthy responses to deal with difficulties and stress-management</li>
    <li>Discipline and consistency with self-improvement, notably for dealing with stress and time management</li>
    <li>Adopt and implement time-management skills, including for structuring my day and for being able to estimate the time required to complete a task or project</li>
    <li>Be a trusted and respected team member</li>
    <li>Develop and sustain a proactive growth mindset</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
</div>

<div class=" Content-section Actions">
<h3>4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>
<p>
  I commit to attempting to complete the sprint and bootcamp materials in accordance with the prescribed time guidelines and deadlines. In the event that, for whatever reason, when struggling with the material or thinking that meeting the deadlines for submission of the sprint coursework is looking possibly unachievable, I will contact the facilitators to advise them of this and to discuss what options are available. </p>

 <p> I will make efforts to foster positive, collegial relationships with my fellow students and to interact with them how I hope they would interact with me: with trust, empathy, respect, supportiveness and positivity </p> 
</div>


<div class=" Content-section Actions">
<h3>5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>I will be honest with myself and maintain clear and open lines of communications with the facilitators and the rest of the teaching and administrative staff</li>
    <li>I will disclose and talk about any diffculties that might affect my work as soon as they arise and not be afraid to ask for help, if suitable</li>
  </p>
</div>


<div class=" Content-section Actions">
<h3>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
<p>
I expect that I will be able to speak to the facilitation team in confidence and that any personal information that is discussed with them will remain private. As with my fellow students, I hope that they will demonstrate the values of trust, respect, empathy,supportiveness, and positivity
</p>
</div>

<div class=" Content-section Actions">
  <h3>7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
  <p> None at this stage. In the event that any such commitments should require time that interferes with my learning commitments, I will discuss this with the Facilitators.
