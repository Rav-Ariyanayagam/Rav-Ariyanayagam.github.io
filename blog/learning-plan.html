  <h3><em>Bootcamp Update</em></h3>
  <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
  <p>I would like to work as a software developer for organisation that deals with social and cultural problems, this could be anywhere a company like Flicks.co.nz/Vista or a government organisation or NFP. Separately from that, I would also like to build an app that helps people in civic instruction and the concept of citizenship.</p>


  <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
  <p>I am still very much the same person that I was several weeks ago before the Foundations began and my struggles with confidence and stress and time management are all things that I know I will need to continue to work on for the rest of my life. </p>

  <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>

  <p>My biggest non-technical challenge will be my stamina. I expect the bootcamp to be very demanding (physically, mentally, and emotionally) and my concern is that when stressed, it tends to affect my ability to sleep and to recover, which then affects my energy, and it becomes one big self-perpetuating loop of negativity. </p>

  <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
  <p>I really would like to develop my abillity to be kinder/less harsh on myself as well as the practice of mindfulness, to be able to not get as caught up in my emotional state and to be better able to handle stress as I believe this could be a real game changer for me. I'd also like to work on practicing different communication styles so as to be more competent and effective at communicating with a wider range of people. </p>

  <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
  <p>I expect the Bootcamp team to exhbit Dev Academy's values of aroha, pono, and tika, for them to be patient and kind with me, and to be willing to put in the effort to help ensure that I understand the concepts and knowledge that they are trying to share - this means being available, within reason, and adaptable. </p>


  <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
  <p>My commitment to myself and to the rest of the cohort and the facilitators is that I will dedicate my time as previously agreed, that I will be honest with myself and with others, that I will try my best to be patient and kind with myself and my fellow students, that I will not be afraid to ask for help, and that I will do my best to not get discouraged and remain positive when faced with challenging situations, be they technical or persona/emotional.</p>

  <h3>[Original Learning Plan]</h3>
  <h3>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
  <p id="bullets">
  <ul>
    <li>Become a competent and skilled full-stack web development professional</li>
    <li>Develop intermediate- to advanced-level knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript, React</li>
    <li>Be able to build technical and user-friendly responsive websites and applications from scratch</li>

 <div class=" Content-section LearningPlan">
  <h3>2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
  <h3><em>Strengths</em></h3>
  <p>I am a motivated learner who takes responsibility for my personal and professional education and development. My critical thinking skills are well developed and I am unafraid to ask questions. In the face of difficulties and challenges, I am resilient and driven to make the efforts required in order to achieve my goals.</p>
  <h3><em>Limitations</em></h3>
  <p>In attempting to take individual responsibility for my learning, I sometimes take too long to seek assistance when it is required. This can lead to placing avoidable pressure on myself and making my work more difficult than it could be and/or taking longer than it could have to complete. The cumulative effect of all of this is find myself in an unsustainable pattern where I endure avoidable stress that is both emotionally and physically tiring, ultimately taking a toll on my general health. </p>

</div>

<div class=" Content-section LearningPlan">
  <h3>3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>Healthy responses to deal with difficulties and stress-management</li>
    <li>Discipline and consistency with self-improvement, notably for dealing with stress and time management</li>
    <li>Adopt and implement time-management skills, including for structuring my day and for being able to estimate the time required to complete a task or project</li>

    <li>Develop and sustain a proactive growth mindset</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
</div>

<div class=" Content-section LearningPlan">
  <h3>4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>
  <p>
  I commit to attempting to complete the sprint and bootcamp materials in accordance with the prescribed time guidelines and deadlines. In the event that, for whatever reason, when struggling with the material or thinking that meeting the deadlines for submission of the sprint coursework is looking possibly unachievable, I will contact the facilitators to advise them of this and to discuss what options are available. </p>

 <p> I will make efforts to foster positive, collegial relationships with my fellow students and to interact with them how I hope they would interact with me: with trust, empathy, respect, supportiveness and positivity </p> 
</div>


<div class=" Content-section LearningPlan">
  <h3>5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
    <p>
  <ul>
    <li>I will be honest with myself and maintain clear and open lines of communications with the facilitators and the rest of the teaching and administrative staff</li>
    <li>I will disclose and talk frankly about any diffculties that might affect my work as soon as they arise and not be afraid to ask for help (from the Facilitators and/or fellow students)</li>
  </p>
</div>


<div class=" Content-section LearningPlan">
    <h3>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
    <p>
    I expect that I will be able to speak to the facilitation team in confidence and that any personal information that is discussed with them will remain private. As with my fellow students, I hope that they will demonstrate the values of trust, respect, empathy,supportiveness, and positivity
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class=" Content-section Actions">
    <h3>7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
    <p> None at this stage. In the event that any such commitments should require time that interferes with my learning commitments, I will discuss this with the Facilitators.
