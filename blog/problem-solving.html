        <h3>1. A time when I was blocked on a simple problem</h3>

        <P>I spent a lot of time recently trying to figure what I needed to do do about a situation in which I had come to know that a legal professional had not done his job properly of keeping proper client records and staying up to date on legislative changes. This was a source of much emotional turmoil for me, something that I discussed with several close friends, some of whom are lawyers, and which I spent much time reading about online. In the end, I realised that I was trying to take responsibility for fixing someone else's problem and that <em>that</em> was my actual problem: it was not and never should have been my responsibility, so I advised the person of the issue and asked them to correct their mistake/problem.</p>

        <h3>A time I elegantly solved a problem</h3>

        <p>I was particularly happy this past week with the solution that I found to the "whereAreYou" function problem in the Built-in methods challenge in Replit. I remembered what I had learned from a conversation with a peer relating to a completely different problem about writing code that was concise and efficient by coding functions within a function to solve our problem and meet our requirements. I spent a considerable amount of time watching YouTube clips that talked and walked through similar problems (including some clips that had been shared by my peers in our Discord group) and I also read several of the MDN web docs. Having taken the time to understand this new information, I sat down to write the code, wrote it, and it passed the test first time around - I was stoked. Here it is: </p>

        <h3>3. Reflecting on problem-solving techniques and processes</h3>

        <h5><b>Trying something, Googling, Asking coaches and peers for help, Reflection</b></h5>

        <p>I'm already very familiar with all of these techniques and regularly employ them as part of my ongoing learning and development. As my preference will always be to able to solve a problem myself, I can be somewhat reluctant to (quickly) ask for help from a peer or coach but, that said, I am also not afraid to admit when I have reached the limits of trying something or Googling for help, and to seek assistance from someone else, be it a peer or a coach.</p>

        <h5><b>Pseudocode, Console.logging, Rubber Ducky method, and Reading error messages</b></h5>
  

        <p>Pseudocode is something that I have already employed without actually knowing that there was term for it! I've always found it useful to try to articulate things in different ways and to try to break down a complex problem into smaller pieces to make it more manageable and less intimidating, and the Rubber Ducky method can be very helpful for that. I still don't use console.logging as much as I probably could and it's a diagnostic tool that I've realised I really should be using far more often to help provide me with useful information. Finally, I read the error messages and do take note of the information in there, and when I can understand them and what I have to do to fix the error, it's another very useful tool. </p>
